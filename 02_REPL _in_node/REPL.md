REPL stands for Read-Eval-Print-Loop, which is a built-in feature in Node.js that provides an interactive shell to read input from user, evaluate it and print the result immediately, and loop these command until termination.

The Node.js REPL environment can be accessed by running the **node** command in the terminal without any file arguments. Once the Node.js REPL is active, you can type any valid JavaScript expression and press enter to see its output.

REPL lets you see the result of your input code immediately without going through the compilation phase in the cycle.

In REPL, the variables and the content of memory heap last only for the current session.
